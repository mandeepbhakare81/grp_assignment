This repository contains solutions to 3 out of 4 problems given to me.
I am working on ROS problem and add it's solution soon.
All programs were written and ran using online IDE onlinegdb.
While developing I used intuitive names for function and argument instead of solution, A and B for ease of development.
Later it was changed to solution, A and B to be consistent with problem statements.
Though I have tested the code, you may find reference to older names in comment.
All these programs were written by myself using original logic.
