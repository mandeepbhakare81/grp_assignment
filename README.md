I have written and ran programs using online IDE onlinegdb.
I also user friedly names for function or argument instead of solution, A and B for ease of development.
Later it was changed to solution, A and B to be consistent with problem statements.
Though I have tested the code, you may find reference to older names in comment.
All these programs were written by myself using original logic.
